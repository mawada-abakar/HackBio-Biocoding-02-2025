# Stage-0
This project demonstrates how to store and display personal details using R in the HackBio Stage-0 Biocoding Internship.

Steps to Follow:

  1.Set Up Your Environment
     Ensure R is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from CRAN.
     Optionally, install RStudio for an enhanced coding experience.
     
 2.Define Your Personal Information
    Store your details as variables in R
    
# Define personal details

name <- "Your Name"

slack_username <- "@YourSlackUsername"

email <- "your.email@example.com"

hobby <- "Your Hobby"

country <- "Your Country"

discipline <- "Your Discipline"

preferred_language <- "R"

# Display information
personal_info <- data.frame(
  Field = c("Name", "Slack Username", "Email", "Hobby", "Country", "Discipline", "Preferred Programming Language"),
  Value = c(name, slack_username, email, hobby, country, discipline, preferred_language)
)

print(personal_info)


# Stage-1
This repository contains solutions for Stage-1 of the HackBio Biocoding Internship. The scripts are written in R and cover different bioinformatics-related tasks.

# Project Overview
This repository contains four R scripts that perform various bioinformatics and computational tasks, including:

1-Translating DNA to protein sequences

2-Simulating and visualizing logistic growth curves

3-Determining the time to reach 80% of carrying capacity

4-Calculating Hamming distance between two strings

These scripts are designed to help with biological data analysis and computational research in genomics and population modeling.

 #Installation & Setup
 
 -Install R (if not already installed)
    Download and install R from CRAN.

 -Install Required R Packages
    Some scripts use additional libraries. Install them using:
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))

# Scripts Overview

# 1-Translating DNA to protein sequences

This script converts a DNA sequence into a protein sequence using the standard genetic code.

üîπ How it Works:

-Takes a DNA sequence as input.
-Splits the sequence into codons (triplets).
-Maps each codon to an amino acid using the genetic code table.
-Returns the translated protein sequence.

üîπ Usage Example:
source("dna_to_protein.R")
dna_sequence <- "ATGGCCATTGTAATGGGCCGCTGAAAGGGTGCCCGATAG"
protein <- dna_to_protein(dna_sequence)
print(protein)  # Output: "MAMIVMGRAKGA*"

# 2-Logistic Growth Simulation & Growth Curves

This script simulates and visualizes logistic growth curves for 100 different populations.

üîπ How it Works:

-Uses a logistic growth model to simulate population growth.
-Randomizes lag phase and exponential phase for variation.
-Generates a dataframe with 100 different growth curves.
-Plots a subset of the growth curves.

üîπ Usage Example:
source("logistic_growth.R")
growth_data <- generate_growth_data(100)
head(growth_data)  # View first few rows

# 3-Determining the time to reach 80% of carrying capacity

This script determines the time when population growth reaches 80% of the carrying capacity (K) in a logistic model.

üîπ How it Works:

-Simulates logistic growth using the growth equation.
-Identifies the first time point where the population reaches 80% of K.

üîπ Usage Example:
source("time_to_80_percent.R")
time <- seq(0, 50, 1)
growth_curve <- simulate_logistic_growth(time)
time_80 <- time_to_80_percent(growth_curve)
print(paste("Time to reach 80% of K:", time_80))

# 4-Calculating Hamming distance between two strings

This script calculates the Hamming distance between two strings (e.g., Slack username vs Twitter handle).

üîπ How it Works:

-Pads the shorter string with spaces to make lengths equal.
-Compares characters at each position.
-Counts the number of different characters.

üîπ Usage Example:
source("hamming_distance.R")
slack_username <- "BioCoder123"
twitter_handle <- "BioDevGuy"
distance <- hamming_distance(slack_username, twitter_handle)
print(paste("Hamming Distance:", distance)) # Output : "Hamming Distance: 5"
